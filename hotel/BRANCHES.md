# Branch Usage

- **main**: Stable base of the project.
- **OSCAR**: Personal working branch created from `main`. Synced with `main` at commit `5b8c9f1`.
- **develop**: Shared integration branch created from `main` for ongoing work.

When starting new work, create feature branches from `develop` or `OSCAR` as needed to keep `main` stable.
